title: Pasta primavera

## Ingredients

- 75g young broad beans (use frozen if you can't get fresh)
- 2 x 100g pack asparagus tips
- 170g peas (use frozen if you can't get fresh)
- 350g spaghetti or tagliatelle
- 175g pack baby leeks, trimmed and sliced
- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve
- 1 tbsp butter
- 200ml tub fromage frais or creme fraiche
- handful fresh chopped herbs (we used mint, parsley and chives)
- parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), shaved, to serve

## Method

1.  Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and put a steamer (or colander) over
    the water. Steam the beans, asparagus and peas until just tender, then set
    aside. Boil the pasta following pack instructions.

1.  Meanwhile, fry the leeks gently in the oil and butter for 5 mins or until
    soft. Add the fromage frais to the leeks and very gently warm through,
    stirring constantly to ensure it doesnâ€™t split. Add the herbs and steamed
    vegetables with a splash of pasta water to loosen.

1.  Drain the pasta and stir into the sauce. Adjust the seasoning, then serve
    scattered with the cheese and drizzled with a little extra olive oil.
