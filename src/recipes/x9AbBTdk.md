title: Shortbread
---

## Ingredients

- 125g sugar
- 250g butter
- 375g plain flour
- Pinch of salt

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150C.

1. Place all the ingredients into a bowl and blend together carefully until it
   just forms a dough. Be careful not to overwork it.

1. Roll into a cylinder or cuboid and slice to about the thickness of a Â£1 coin.

1. Bake for about 30m in the bottom of the oven, checking frequently after about
   20m to ensure none of them are catching. They are ready when they're a golden
   brown colour on the bottom of the biscuit.

1. Leave to cool and store in an airtight box.

## Notes

It may be crumbly but that is how it should be - if it becomes "doughy" you
won't get that perfect crumbly texture that's typical of homemade shortbread.

Don't be tempted to add any liquid if the dough doesn't seem to be coming
together - this will destroy the texture when finished. Just turn it out onto a
surface and press it together with your hands.

Keep them plain. Adding honey, lemon, vanilla or whatever will impact the
texture. The star of the show is the _butter_ - that is what you should taste,
so use the best you can find.

They're called "short" because they are made with shortening (butter). They're
called "bread" because the inventors wanted to avoid the tax on confectionary
items in order to make more money.

It is a low oven temperature but don't turn it up to get them done quicker. The
shortbreads do better cooking longer at a lower oven temperature to make sure
they dry out and obtain an even, very pale golden hue. Consider rotating the
baking tray if they seem to be baking unevenly.
