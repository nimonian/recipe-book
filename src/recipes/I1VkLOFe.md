title: Guacamole
---

## Ingredients

- 1 ripe avocado
- 1/2 clove garlic
- 1/2 lime

## Method

1.  In a pestle and mortar, bash the garlic with some salt and pepper into a
    paste. Add the lime juice and mix it up with the pestle to release the
    garlic from the sides of the mortar.

1.  Peel and chop the avocado, then bash it with the other ingredients in the
    pestle and mortar until it forms a chunky paste.

## Notes

It is best served straight away.

The salt and pepper will help make the garlic into a paste in the pestle and
mortar.

The avocados have to be properly ripe. If they're a bit firm, they won't turn
into a paste. As a rule of thumb, if you can't make the avocado into a paste
with the pestle and mortar, it's not ripe enough (i.e. you shouldn't need a food
processor).

Some people add fresh coriander, yoghurt or fresh chilli. But I like my
\guacamole ridiculously simple, with the avocado front and center.
