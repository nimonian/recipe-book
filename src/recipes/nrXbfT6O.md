title: Scones
---

## Ingredients

- 450g self-raising flour
- 14g baking powder
- 50g sugar
- 100g butter
- 300ml milk

## Method

1. Heat an oven to 200C.

1. Sift the flour. Mix in the baking powder and sugar.

1. Ensure the butter is at room temperature. Rub it into the dry ingredients so
   that the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.

1. Pour in the milk and combine with a spoon until the dough just about comes
   together. Don't overwork it.

1. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flatten it to about 5cm thick,
   fold it in half and flatten it again, then fold it over again. Flour the
   surface well and flatten the dough to 5cm thick one last time.

1. Use a circular cutter to cut out the scones. Turn them _upside down_ onto the
   baking tray so that the floured side is facing up.

1. Bake for 18 - 22 minutes. The bottom of the scone should be golden, and they
   should sound hollow when tapped. Let them cool then dust sparingly with flour
   through a fine seive.

## Notes

I don't add dried fruit as I find it interferes with the delicate dough. The
fruit tends to soak up the milk and affects the overall texture.

Serve with jam and clotted cream. They also go great with [cr√®me Chantilly]().

You can brush the top with egg wash if you prefer, but I'm not a fan.

Once you've cut out your scones, there will be leftover mixture. You can bring
it back together to make more, but be aware that the texture will be a bit
denser. I prefer to chop up the remaining dough into small chunks and deep fry
it then roll in cinnamon sugar. I call them sconuts and they're better than they
should be.
