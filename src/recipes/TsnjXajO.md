title: Tuna, caper and chilli spaghetti
---

## Ingredients

- 150g spaghetti or linguine
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, sliced
- 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped, plus extra to serve (optional)
- 1 tbsp drained capers
- small bunch of parsley, finely chopped (stalks included)
- 145g tuna in spring water, drained
- 90g rocket or baby spinach leaves
- ½ lemon, juiced

## Method

1.  Cook the spaghetti for 9-11 mins in a large pan of well-salted water until
    al dente.

1.  Heat the oil in a wide frying pan over a very low heat, and gently cook the
    garlic and chilli to infuse the oil. Remove from the heat if the garlic is
    turning past light golden, as this will make it bitter.

1.  Drain the pasta, keeping a cupful of the cooking water, and tip the
    spaghetti into the frying pan. Toss the pasta in the oil over a low heat,
    adding a little of the pasta water to emulsify into a sauce that coats the
    pasta, then fold in the capers, parsley, tuna and some seasoning. Don’t stir
    too vigorously – you want to keep larger chunks of tuna. Toss the rocket and
    lemon juice through the spaghetti, and serve with extra chilli scattered
    over, if you like.
