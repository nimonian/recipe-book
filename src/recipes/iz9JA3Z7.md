title: Chicken satay salad
---

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp tamari
- 1 tsp medium curry powder
- ¼ tsp ground cumin
- 1 garlic clove, finely grated
- 1 tsp clear honey
- 2 skinless chicken breast fillets (or use turkey breast)
- 1 tbsp crunchy peanut butter (choose a sugar-free version with no palm oil, if
  possible)
- 1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- sunflower oil, for wiping the pan
- 2 Little Gem lettuce hearts, cut into wedges
- ¼ cucumber, halved and sliced
- 1 banana shallot, halved and thinly sliced
- coriander, chopped
- seeds from 1/2 pomegranate

## Method

1.  Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin,
    garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally
    to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat.
    Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the
    flavours to penetrate the chicken.

1.  Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1
    tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a
    large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook,
    covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over
    for the last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest
    for a few mins.

1.  While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot,
    coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce.
    Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining
    sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.
