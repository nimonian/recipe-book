title: Chicken hummus bowl
---

## Ingredients

- 200g hummus
- 1 small lemon, zested and juiced
- 200g pouch cooked mixed grains
- 150g baby spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 small avocado, halved and sliced
- 1 cooked chicken breast, sliced at an angle
- 100g pomegranate seeds
- Â½ red onion, finely sliced
- 2 tbsp toasted almonds

## Method

1.  Mix 2 tbsp of the hummus with half the lemon juice, the lemon zest and
    enough water to make a drizzly dressing. Squeeze the grain pouch to separate
    the grains, then divide between two shallow bowls and toss through the
    dressing. Top each bowl with a handful of the spinach.

1.  Squeeze the remaining lemon juice over the avocado halves, then add one half
    to each bowl. Divide the chicken, pomegranate seeds, onion, almonds and
    remaining hummus between the two bowls and gently mix everything together
    just before eating.
