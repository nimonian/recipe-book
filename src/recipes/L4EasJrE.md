title: Chicken, broccoli and beetroot salad with avocado pesto
---

## Ingredients

- 250g thin-stemmed broccoli
- 2 tsp avocado oil
- 3 skinless chicken breasts
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 100g bag watercress
- 2 raw beetroots (about 175g), peeled and julienned or grated
- 1 tsp nigella seeds

### For the avocado pesto

- small pack basil
- 1 avocado
- ½ garlic cloves, crushed
- 25g walnut halves, crumbled
- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- juice and zest 1 lemon

## Method

1.  Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the broccoli and cook for 2
    mins. Drain, then refresh under cold water. Heat a griddle pan, toss the
    broccoli in 1⁄2 tsp of the rapeseed oil and griddle for 2-3 mins, turning,
    until a little charred. Set aside to cool. Brush the chicken with the
    remaining oil and season. Griddle for 3-4 mins each side or until cooked
    through. Leave to cool, then slice or shred into chunky pieces.

1.  Next, make the pesto. Pick the leaves from the basil and set aside a handful
    to top the salad. Put the rest in the small bowl of a food processor. Scoop
    the flesh from the avocado and add to the food processor with the garlic,
    walnuts, oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2-3 tbsp cold water and some seasoning.
    Blitz until smooth, then transfer to a small serving dish. Pour the
    remaining lemon juice over the sliced onions and leave for a few mins.

1.  Pile the watercress onto a large platter. Toss through the broccoli and
    onion, along with the lemon juice they were soaked in. Top with the
    beetroot, but don’t mix it in, and the chicken. Scatter over the reserved
    basil leaves, the lemon zest and nigella seeds, then serve with the avocado
    pesto.
