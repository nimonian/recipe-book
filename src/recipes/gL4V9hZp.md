title: Ginger chicken udon noodles
---

## Ingredients

- 1 tsp sunflower oil
- 3 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
- Â¼ white cabbage, finely sliced
- 25g ginger, peeled and finely grated
- 1 red chilli (deseeded if you like), finely chopped
- 1 tbsp low-salt soy sauce
- 2 tsp rice vinegar
- 2 tsp mirin
- 100g ready-to-eat beansprouts
- 3 spring onions, finely sliced
- 300g straight-to-wok udon noodles
- small handful of coriander, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp pickled ginger (optional)

## Method

1.  Heat the oil in a large, deep frying pan over a medium-high heat and, once
    hot, stir-fry the chicken and cabbage for 5-7 mins until browned and almost
    cooked through. Add the ginger and chilli, and cook for a few minutes more
    until fragrant.

1.  Add the remaining ingredients, except the coriander and pickled ginger, and
    fry until the chicken is cooked and the noodles are tender, about 1-2 mins
    more. Season, adding more soy, vinegar or mirin, if you like. Top with the
    coriander and pickled ginger, if using.
