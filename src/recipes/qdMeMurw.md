title: Salsa
---

## Ingredients

- 1 red onion
- 1 yellow pepper
- 2 tomatoes
- Fresh coriander
- 1/2 lime
- 1 chilli or 1tsp hot sauce, or both (optional)

## Method

1.  Finely dice the red onion, yellow pepper and tomatoes. Keep all the tomato
    juice and seeds, there's no need to toss them.

1.  Grate the lime zest, chop the corainder and finely chop the chilli and at it
    all to the bowl. Sprinkle in some salt and pepper and add the lime juice and
    hot sauce. Mix it all well.

## Notes

Dice everything as fine as you can so that the salsa sits nicely on a tortilla
chip. If it's too chunky, it's hard to scoop.

Put it on nachos, tortillas, tacos, chilli beef, grilled fish or anything else
you think it'll taste good with.

It will last a couple of days and probably tastes better if you can let it sit
in the fridge for a couple of hours before eating.
